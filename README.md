# Accidents Detection and Prevention System 

### Synopsis
Every day around the world, a large percentage of people die from traffic accident injuries. An influential indicator of survival rates after detecting the accident is the time between the occurrence of the accident and the arrival of emergency responders to the scene. Such happenings can be overcomed either by preventing such a scenario  or supplying immediate help on time.
Car  accidents  are considered  one  of the  most destructive phenomena. Though there are many different  reasons  behind car accidents,  most accidents occur  due to driverâ€™s unawareness and uncontrolled speed. Also, there seems to be a problem reaching the spot of accident in time for lack  of  awareness.  As  a  solution,  the advent  of  Internet  of Things (IoT) technologies can reduce the number of accidents. In  this  project, we propose a  smart system  which keeps monitoring the closeby obstacles  and alerts  the user,  and also  notifies  the  individuals accordingly when an accident occurs. This system always monitors the distance  between vehicles  and obstacles that are in front, using an ultrasonic sensor. It will alert the driver to control the speed and reduce the distance when a critical distance comes. Whenever an accident takes place for an uncertain condition, an sms alert will be sent to the accountable individual with location details.
